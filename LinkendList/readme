The primary operations that generally form a part of the LinkedList class are listed below:

insertAtTail(data) - inserts an element at the end of the linked list
insertAtHead(data) - inserts an element at the start/head of the linked list
delete(data) - deletes an element with your specified value from the linked list
deleteAtHead() - deletes the first element of the list
deleteAtTail() - deletes the first element of the list
search(data) - searches for an element in the linked list
isEmpty() - returns true if the linked list is empty
printList - print all the node value
getHead() - print node data separate by ' -> '


del or serach by value - O(n)

Difference betweem Array and LinkedList ?
1. Array elements store in a contiguous memory location.
    Linked list elements can be stored anywhere in the memory or randomly stored.
2. Array works with Static memory.
    Linked List works with dyanamic memory
3. array insertion and deletion takes more time
   linkedList insertion deletion takes less time
4. accessing element in an array is faster
    accessing element in an LL is slower
5. complie time memory allocated 
    dyanaic time meemory allocation
