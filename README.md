Educative :

basics: functions, hoisting, arrow functions, rest/spread syntax, closure, setTimeout, bind function, destructuring syntax, and IIFE.

type coercion: typeof and instanceof operators, and prototype.toString.

event handling: event bubbling, capturing, and delegation

asynchronous callbacks: callbacks, promises, and async/await

OPP in Javascript: prototypes, ES5 and ES6 versions of inheritance, and mixins.

functional programming: currying, pure/impure functions, higher-order functions, shallow copy, and deep copy

security: strict mode and the same-origin policy.

DOM basics.
